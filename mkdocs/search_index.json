We provide general abstractions and algorithms for modeling and optimization, implementations of common models, tools for working with datasets, and much more.\n\n\nThe design and structure of the organization is geared towards a modular and composable approach to all things data science.  Plug and play models, losses, penalties, and algorithms however you see fit, and at whatever granularity is appropriate.  Beginner users and those looking for ready-made solutions can use the convenience package \nLearn\n.  For custom modeling solutions, choose methods and components from any package:\n\n\nLearn\n\n\nAn all-in-one workbench, which simply imports and re-exports the packages below.  This is a convenience wrapper for an easy way to get started with the JuliaML ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\nCore\n\n\nLearnBase\n\n\nThe abstractions and methods for JuliaML packages.
